Open your command line interface (like Terminal on MacOS/Linux or Command Prompt on Windows).
Navigate to the directory where your Python script is located using the cd command. For example:
cd /path/to/your/script

Run your Python script with the file path as a command-line argument. For example:
python your_script.py /path/to/your/file

In this command, python runs the Python interpreter, your_script.py is the name of your Python script, and /path/to/your/file is the file path you want to pass to the script. You should replace these with the actual names on your system.
